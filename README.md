# About us

RLadies Vancouver is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global (https://rladies.org/), a worldwide organization promoting gender diversity in the R community..

The mission of the RLadies Vancouver is to create a friendly and inclusive environment where R learners, teachers and developers can work on improving their skills together. We focus on encouraging participation of gender minorities that are underrepresented in the programming realm.

Everyone is welcome to join our events. You could be a complete novice or a seasoned R user interested in mentoring and networking. This community is for you, join us! Please respect, however, that this group is lady-focused.
